    # that goes stale - which it did once already, shipping a wheel without the
    # GPU renderer. tests/packaging.py checks these against what viewer.py reads.

    # from. tools/bundle.py concatenates and minifies each target; the panels
    # stay loose because viewer.py adds them only when the config asks.
