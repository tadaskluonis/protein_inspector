/* WebGL2 cartoon renderer - the same drawing as cartoon/geom.js, resident on
 * the GPU so that turning the model costs one draw call instead of one full
 * repaint.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: a second cartoon renderer. It does not decide where a
 * ribbon goes, how wide it is, which way a helix faces or what colour anything
 * takes. It asks cartoon/geom.js for its primitives ONCE, lifts them back
 * into model space, and re-paints them from any angle. Every shading rule in
 * here is a port of a rule in that file, arrived at by measuring one against
 * the other - see tests/GPU3D_NOTES.md for what each is and why. A second
 * implementation of any of them would drift silently.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT WITH THE 2D RENDERER is three opt-in hooks, all default off:
 *   _frameProbe   emit each station's frame in MODEL space. A projected
 *                 drawing gives a frame's direction but not its SIGN.
 *   _noViewCull   keep primitives outside the viewport. Dropping them is right
 *                 for painting a frame and wrong for harvesting geometry.
 *   _probeOnly    return once the prims exist; the rest is a frame nobody sees.
 *
 * PARAMETERS ARRIVE AS AN OBJECT, never read from a document. The measurement
 * harness in tests/ builds that object from its own controls; the app builds it
 * from the renderer's own properties. One producer each, and the module has no
 * opinion about where a page keeps its state.

  // with aTop saying which side each one is. So both compute the SAME oB, cross
  // zero at the same point, and one picks up precisely where the other leaves
  // off. Nothing falls through the gap because there is no gap.

  // faces of a piece back to front, keyed on bAvg - the piece MEAN - so one
  // side wins over the whole piece and a fold shows as a clean edge. Read per
  // fragment, the GPU flipped sides part-way through a piece the reference had
  // not cut, and the pale inner face came through the coloured outer one as a
  // wedge at every helix fold. That is the 6MRR report.

/* ======================================================= THE TUBE STYLE
 * A different drawing and a much simpler one. Where the cartoon builds a mesh
 * of ribbon slabs, the tube style is one CAPSULE per segment: the 2D pass
 * strokes a thick round-capped line between two projected positions and fills a
 * disc at each end. So there is nothing to capture and nothing to unproject -
 * the geometry IS the coordinates, and the whole port is one instanced quad per
 * segment with the capsule solved in the fragment shader.
 *
 * WHAT THE GPU DOES DIFFERENTLY, and it is the reason to do this at all: the 2D
 * pass has no depth buffer, so it sorts segments back to front and paints them
 * whole. Two tubes that genuinely cross therefore have to pick a winner, and
 * the loser passes behind at the crossing even where it should emerge in front.
 * Writing gl_FragDepth from the capsule's own surface makes them intersect.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS DECIDE THE COLOUR. The tube's shading is screen-space
 * occlusion - every segment darkened by whatever lies in front of it - which is
 * core/mol.js's own calculation, cached and recomputed when a gesture settles
 * rather than per frame. The colour arrives here already shaded, one per
 * segment, and is re-uploaded when that cache is rebuilt. During a drag there is
 * nothing to upload and the frame is one draw call.

// SCREEN-SPACE OCCLUSION, and the reason it exists rather than the CPU pass.

// The 2D renderer shades a segment by testing it against every other segment
// in front of it: two nested loops over the visible list, a grid above a size
// threshold. It is the single most expensive thing in the style - on 9FOG it
// is ~90% of the frame - and it grows with the structure, which is the wrong
// direction when the whole point of the GPU path is 3J3Q.
//
// The kernels below are the CPU's, unchanged: a rational stand-in for a
// sigmoid, c^2 / (c^2 + d^2 * 2), summed for shadow and maxed for tint, with
// the same cutoffs derived from the same reference bond lengths. What changes
// is WHAT IS SUMMED OVER. The CPU sums over segments; this sums over samples
// of the depth field the capsules just wrote, so the cost is a function of the
// number of PIXELS and not of the number of segments. Ten thousand segments
// cost exactly what five hundred do.
//
// Two consequences worth naming, because they are visible:
//
//  - It is better at crossings. The CPU compares segment CENTRES, so where one
//    strand passes over another the shadow is attributed to the whole segment
//    and the crossing softens into a general darkening. Sampling the depth
//    field puts the darkening where the strands actually cross, and the two
//    read as two, which is the thing a tube drawing has to get right.
//  - It only sees the front-most surface along each ray, where the CPU counts
//    every segment behind it too. That undercounts burial by a roughly
//    constant factor, which is what uDensity absorbs.
// THE MATCHING RESOLVE. A 4x4 box, which is exactly the period of the
// interleaved rotation above, so every output pixel averages one full set of
// sixteen sample orientations.
//
// It is depth-weighted, and that is not a refinement. A plain box would drag
// the dark band from behind a crossing out across the strand in front of it,
// and that halo is what makes screen-space occlusion look dirty. Weighting each
// tap by how near its depth is to the centre's keeps the average inside one
// surface: smooth along a tube, hard where one passes over another - which is
// the one place the drawing needs an edge.

  //    survives only in fragments, and because each fragment is butt-cut square
  //    at the joints, two segments meeting at an angle leave two straight
  //    dashes crossing each other. Those are the crosses at the corners. Deeper
  //    sinking just erases more of the rim - measured, the dark pixels fell
  //    steadily and the crosses never went away.

    // belongs to, not the depth of the rim it sits on.

    // This is the part that took two wrong answers to find. The 2D painter
    // decides coverage per SEGMENT: it strokes a rim, fills it, and moves to
    // the next one, so a nearer segment's rim covers a farther segment
    // outright. A depth buffer decides per PIXEL, and the thing it compares
    // against is the far tube's BULGED surface - which stands up to a radius
    // proud of its axis and can therefore poke in front of the near tube's rim

    // pixel of rim is erased. Strung along a segment that is exactly a rim
    // chopped into dashes, and where two segments meet at an angle the two sets
    // of dashes cross - the crosses at the corners.
    //
    // Giving the skirt zAxis + r makes it as near as its own tube ever gets, so
    // it beats everything its own tube beats and the rim comes back in one
    // piece. uPushZ then settles the exact ties (a joint, where both tubes'
    // front surfaces meet at the shared point) in the fill's favour.
    // HOW FAR TOWARD THE EYE THE SKIRT SITS, as a fraction of the tube's
    // radius, and it is the one number that decides whether the outline is

 * +120 MB, against a fill of 36. It was one object per edge, nineteen fields
 * apiece, in a Map of Maps; a capsid multiplies that by ten and the build
 * already peaks at 4,160 MB against a ~4.3 GB limit.
 *
 * So the fields live in two flat arrays and the map holds an INDEX. The map
 * itself stays, and so does the ITERATION ORDER - the outline instances are
 * emitted in the order the map yields them, and the ink pass draws with the
 * depth mask off, so a later stroke paints over an earlier one. Reordering

/**
 * TWO HALVES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVER REBUILT FOR A SIDE CHAIN.
 *
 * Showing a few side chains APPENDS positions, so every term of the mesh
 * signature moves and the whole cartoon was rebuilt - 8,514 ribbon faces
 * recomputed to draw 182 new stick ones. What made that avoidable is three
 * measurements, all on 4HHB with 400 side chains out:
 *
 *   * the ribbon half does not change. Hashed over its faces' corners and
 *     colours it is byte-identical with the side chains on, off, and on again;
 *   * the weld that removes doubled lines never pairs a stick face with a
 *     ribbon one - 1,295 welds, none mixed;
 *   * and neither does the edge map - 30,119 edges, none claimed by both.
 *
 * So the two halves can be built separately and concatenated. What that COSTS
 * is the draw order: the halves arrive ribbon-then-stick rather than
 * interleaved by depth, and where a stick surface and the ribbon it grows out
 * of land on exactly the same depth, `depthFunc(LESS)` gives the pixel to
 * whichever was drawn first. That moves 260 pixels of 357,604, all of them on
 * seams, none on open ribbon - and the winner at a tie was already arbitrary,
 * being whichever face the depth sort happened to put first.
 *
 * The ribbon half is cached against a HASH OF ITS OWN FACES rather than
 * against the signature. A key assembled from renderer state is a list of
 * terms someone has to keep complete, and this file's history is largely the
 * story of a term going missing; a hash of the thing itself cannot forget one.
 * It costs about a millisecond and it fails safe - a miss rebuilds.

 * highlight overlay, picking and both exports on exactly the path they are on
 * today - the GPU replaces the DRAW, not the frame.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED is a signature over everything the mesh is built from. Anything
 * not in it is a redraw: the rotation, the zoom, the ortho slider, shade,
 * highlight, fade, smooth, the pencil, the ink weight and the whole palette.
 * Anything in it rebuilds, which costs one 2D render with the painter switched

/* ------------------------------------------------- the tube instance buffer
 * One instance per drawn segment: its two ends in MODEL space, its radius in
 * Angstrom, and the colour core/mol.js already shaded. Ten floats.
 *
 * NOTHING IS CAPTURED. The cartoon path has to run the 2D renderer to find out
 * where its ribbon goes; a tube segment runs between two positions and that is
 * all it is, so the geometry comes straight off `rotatedCoords` un-rotated -
 * which is just `coords` centred, the same space the ribbon mesh lives in.
 */
/* WHAT FORCES THE INSTANCE BUFFER TO BE REBUILT.
 *
 * IDENTITY, NOT A DIGEST. The first version of this asked signatureOf and
 * hashed the colours, which is what the cartoon path does - and on a large
 * structure that is the frame. Measured at 320,000 positions: colourDigest
 * alone was ~9 ms of a ~20 ms frame, walking 300,000 colour objects to
 * establish that not one of them had changed.
 *
 * It can be answered by pointer comparison instead, and exactly, because
 * core/mol.js never edits any of these in place:
 *
 *  - `colors` is ALWAYS a fresh array out of _calculateSegmentColors /
 *    _calculatePlddtColors; there is no in-place recolour anywhere in the file.
 *  - `visiblePositions` is only ever assigned - null, a new Set, or a freshly
 *    combined one. Never .add/.delete/.clear on the live mask.
 *  - `segmentIndices` is rebuilt into a new array whenever it changes.
 *
 * So a changed pointer means changed contents, and an unchanged pointer means
 * unchanged contents. (The cartoon path's own digest carries a comment saying
 * the app "recomputes it in place, so the reference never moves". That is not
 * true of core/mol.js, and the cartoon path is paying an O(n) hash per frame
 * for the same reason this one was. Left alone here: it feeds a palette upload
 * decision, not a mesh rebuild, and is not this change's business.)
 *
 * What is NOT in the key, deliberately: the canvas size and the view. Every
 * number in an instance is model space - two endpoints in Angstrom, a radius in
 * Angstrom, a colour - so resizing the window does not invalidate one.
 *
 * `renderShadows` is the honest exception: when a caller does ask for the CPU
 * occlusion to be baked in, those numbers change with the view and the buffer
 * has to be rebuilt every frame. Nothing asks for it on this path - the GPU
 * computes its own - but the key must not claim otherwise.
