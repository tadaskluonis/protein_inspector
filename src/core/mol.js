// ONE WAY TO SAY WHICH RESIDUES
// ============================================================================
//
// AT MODULE SCOPE IN core/mol.js, NOT IN THE EMBED. It started in
// parts/embed.js because the embed was the only caller, and that put the
// project's one way of naming residues inside a file the notebook and the
// website do not load. Three things need it: the embed's verbs, contact
// ENDPOINTS - which are an address of one residue and were drifting their own
// key names - and eventually the web app, whose panel does this by hand.
//
// Declared bare here, which is what core/mol.js's module scope is for: those
// declarations ARE the interface (see CLAUDE.md, two kinds of file).
//
// There were four, and no two agreed. setColor took {chain}/{positions}/{range}
// on an object; select took a bare array of indices; setVisibility took Sets of
// what STAYS plus a mode; and contacts named endpoints by chain and AUTHOR
// RESIDUE NUMBER, which nothing else accepted at all. Four spellings of one
// idea, each with its own edge cases, is most of what made this API hard to
// hold - and the visibility one was documented backwards for a year without
// anything noticing.
//
// So: ONE selector, understood everywhere, resolved to a Set of position
// indices. The forms are
//
//     'B'                          a chain, by id
//     [3, 4, 5]  /  new Set(...)   positions outright
//     {chain: 'B'}                 the same, spelled out
//     {positions: [3, 4, 5]}
//     {range: [0, 20]}             positions 0..19, half open, as in Python
//     {residues: [12, 13]}         AUTHOR residue numbers, what the file says
//     {object: 'A', ...}           within that object, not the merged array
//     {type: 'L'}                  ligands ('P' protein, 'N' nucleic)
//     {near: sel}                  within 5 A of that, atom to atom
//     {near: sel, angstroms: 8}    ...or another distance
//     'all' / null                 everything drawn
//
// KEYS COMBINE BY AND, index keys first: {chain: 'B', residues: [12, 13]} is
// two residues of one chain, not a chain plus two residues. positions and range
// union with each other because both name indices, then the chain and residue
// tests narrow what is left.
//
// 🔴 positions AND residues ARE NOT THE SAME NUMBERS, and both are integers, so
// nothing will tell you when you pass one for the other. A POSITION is an index
// into what is drawn, counting from zero across every chain. A RESIDUE is the
// number in the file - it starts wherever the depositor started, repeats across
// chains and skips gaps. `residues` is here because contacts already worked
// this way and there was no way to say it anywhere else.

// `object`, NOT `name`. Two different questions were both spelled name:
// which object do you mean (this), and what shall I call the one you are
// loading (v.load's second argument). One word for both is how you end up
// reading a selector and not knowing which it is.

         * The side-chain table, rewritten for an extracted sub-structure.
         *
         * The table is keyed by POSITION INDEX, and a copy renumbers every
         * position - so it can neither be dropped (the copy then has no side
         * chains at all, and asking for them does nothing) nor carried across
         * unchanged (its indices would name whichever residues happen to land
         * on those numbers). It has to be remapped.
         *
         * A row needs BOTH its residue and its anchor to survive: the
         * coefficients are expressed in the anchor's backbone frame, and
         * without that residue there is no frame to rebuild them in. At the
         * edge of a selection an anchor can fall outside it, so a residue on
         * the boundary may come across without its side chain. That is honest -
         * the alternative is re-anchoring it to a frame the coefficients were
         * never measured against, which would point the side chain somewhere
         * arbitrary.
         *
         * @param {object} sc - the source table, or null
         * @param {Array<number>} selectedIndices - old indices, ascending
         * @returns {object|null} the remapped table

         * everything else - the per-object state that says which of those
         * positions are drawn with a side chain, which carry an element
         * colouring, which nucleotides show a base, what secondary structure
         * has been forced on them, what colour they and their side chains were
         * given, and which pairs are joined by a contact. All of it is
         * keyed by POSITION INDEX, so a copy has to renumber it exactly the
         * way the side-chain table is renumbered, and drop whatever fell
         * outside the selection.
         *
         * None of it used to be carried at all: copying a selection you had

         * and nothing filled them in.
         *
         * EVERY FIELD IS NAMED HERE. That is the trap this file keeps falling

         * buildSidechainTable in src/io/parse.js) which no hot path reads. When a
         * residue is switched on, its atoms are materialised here into ordinary
         * positions of type 'L' with ordinary bonds between them - which is to
         * say, into a ligand. Everything downstream then works with no new code
         * at all: both styles draw them, both depth-sort them correctly against
         * the backbone, picking and selection reach them, and the cartoon draws
         * them as the same sticks it gives a real ligand.
         *
         * They are APPENDED, never inserted. Every position index already in
         * use - selection sets, colour overrides, sse overrides, PAE rows,
         * the sequence strip - keeps its meaning, and a trailing run of 'L'
         * positions is what a file with ligands in it looks like anyway.
         *
         * Coordinates are rebuilt in the file's own frame here, which is exact
         * for the tube style. The cartoon moves its backbone after this point
         * (sheet projection, flattening) and re-derives them from the moved
         * positions - see the side-chain pass in cartoon/geom.js.
         *
         * @returns {object} a NEW data object with the atoms appended; `data`
         *   itself is left alone. The visibility sets are the exception - they
         *   outlive the frame load and are updated in place, both to drop a
         *   previous pass's indices and to follow the residues switched on.

         * CAs happen to be close, and it misses the side chain reaching past
         * them - which is the whole reason anyone asks.
         *
         * The atoms exist whether or not they are DRAWN. A side chain is a
         * table of coefficients in the residue's own frame (see
         * _materialiseSidechains); this rebuilds them for the test and throws
         * them away, so a neighbourhood is the same before and after anyone
         * turns side chains on.

         * Two passes, because rebuilding every side chain in a 300,000-residue
         * assembly to answer a question about twelve of them is not a search,
         * it is a rebuild. The first bins TRACE points and keeps anything whose
         * trace is within cutoff + 2 x SIDECHAIN_REACH; the second rebuilds
         * only those and measures exactly.
         *
         * The seed comes back with the answer, as PyMOL's byres does.
         *
         * `opts.sidechainsOnly` measures SIDE CHAIN TO SIDE CHAIN, with the
         * trace atom left out of both ends - the CA of a protein, the C4' of a
         * nucleotide. A backbone runs past everything it folds against, so an
         * any-atom shell around a binding-site residue is half main chain; this
         * asks the other question, which is which residues have their SIDE
         * CHAINS near each other. A residue with no side-chain atoms at all
         * (glycine, or anything in a backbone-only model) is not in the answer,
