"""The one list of what JavaScript this project has, and who needs it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The same set of files was written out by hand in five places -
index.html's script tags, viewer.py's inline reads, tests/run.sh's
terser loop, and setup.py's package_data - and they had already drifted apart:

  * setup.py did not ship viewer-cartoon-gpu.min.js, which viewer.py opens
    unconditionally. A wheel built by CI raised FileNotFoundError on the first
    show(); a wheel built here did not, because setuptools-scm covered for it.
  * tests/run.sh built viewer-seq.min.js on every run and nothing consumed it,
    while viewer-align.js had no .min.js at all.
  * viewer-msa.min.js, 63 KB, is committed and consumed by nothing.

Five lists that must agree, and nothing checking them, is one list plus four
copies waiting to rot - and the file split about to happen turns nine files into
twenty. So the manifest below is the list, `check` derives every consumer from
it, and tests/run.sh runs `check` in the node lane.

This is deliberately NOT a bundler. The files are classic scripts sharing one
global scope; they concatenate with no ceremony (verified - the whole set passes
`node --check` when cat'd together) and load with plain <script> tags. What is
needed is a manifest, not a module system.

# WHAT EACH APPLICATION ACTUALLY SHIPS.
#
# Many small source files are for reading; nobody should download twenty-two of
# them. A bundle is a named subset, concatenated in MODULES order and minified
# once - so the notebook fetches one script instead of fifteen, and an embed
# carries neither the panels nor the capture machinery it will never open.
#
# `standalone` modules are never in a bundle: align/align.js starts its Worker
# by importing its own URL, which a concatenation does not have.
BUNDLES = {
    # The notebook: everything a Jupyter cell can reach, panels included.
    #
    # PAE and scatter used to be added only when the config asked, as two
    # conditional reads and then as two one-file bundles. They are 15 KB and
    # 8 KB against 466 KB - five per cent - and both register a global and do
    # nothing at all until something asks for them. Two branches in viewer.py,
    # two artefacts and two entries in every list, to save five per cent of one
    # download, was not a trade worth keeping.
    # NO 'mol-align'. parts/align.js is the renderer's side of TM-align, and in
    # a notebook it is dead twice over: the only caller is app/selection.js,
    # which is web-only, and the engine it needs - align/align.js - cannot be
    # concatenated into any bundle at all (see Mod.standalone). Every method it
    # adds throws "the aligner is not loaded" the moment it is reached.
    #
    # Worth removing even though it is small, because the notebook bundle is
    # INLINED INTO THE .ipynb, uncompressed, once per show() cell. Bytes here
    # are paid again for every viewer in the document.

    # ONE NOTEBOOK BUNDLE, WITH BOTH PAINTERS. There were three - GPU, 2D, and
    # a tube-only one without the cartoon geometry - and they existed for one
    # reason: this file is inlined into the .ipynb, uncompressed, ONCE PER
    # show() CELL, so a notebook with five viewers carried five copies and
    # every kilobyte was paid five times.
    #
    # SHARING ends that. The first viewer of a session writes the library
    # and lends it over a BroadcastChannel; every later one asks. The bytes are
    # paid once for the document, so the reason to ship three narrow builds
    # instead of one complete one is gone.
    #
    # WHAT THE SECOND PAINTER COSTS: 26 KB. paint2d.js is 81% comment and
    # minifies to 25 against paintgl's 71. What it buys is everything that was
    # given up to save it - `gpu` is a runtime choice again rather than a
    # choice of FILE, a machine without WebGL2 has a painter to fall back on,
    # and the cartoon can export an SVG, which needs the 2D painter because a
    # raster has no vector to hand back.
    #
    # And a notebook that mixes the two stops paying twice: one gpu=True viewer
    # and one gpu=False used to carry 429 + 384 KB of two different libraries,
    # neither of which could serve the other.

    # ONE PAINTER PER BUNDLE, AND OUTSIDE THE WEBSITE IT IS THE GPU.
    #
    # The website keeps both and a toggle; everything else picks one and has no
    # fallback behind it. What that does to a download depends entirely on what
    # the bundle carried before, so the three numbers go in three directions and
    # only one of them is a saving:
    #
    #   notebook    478 -> 453 KB   had BOTH; dropped paint2d          -25
    #   embed       321 -> 414 KB   had paint2d; swapped for paintgl   +93
    #
    # THERE WAS A THIRD, AND GOING GPU-ONLY IS WHAT ENDED IT. embed-tube was the
    # small one: tube only, no cartoon geometry, no painter at all - the tube is
    # drawn by _drawFrame in core/mol.js - and it came to 195 KB against embed's
    # 321. Needing paintgl took it to 313 against 415. A quarter smaller, for a
    # build that cannot draw a cartoon, is not a choice worth offering or a
    # second artefact worth keeping in step.
    #
    # MEASURE THIS MINIFIED, NOT IN LINES. paint2d.js is 2,487 lines and 25 KB
    # minified; paintgl.js is 5,834 lines and 118 KB. Twice the source, nearly
    # five times the download - paint2d is 81% comment and whitespace against
    # paintgl's 62%, so line counts understate the swap by half.
    #
    # What it buys is what the sizes were never the point of: 26 ms a frame on a
    # capsid against 840, and 455 ms to first paint against 1,813.
    #
    # TWO THINGS FOLLOW AND ARE NOT OPTIONAL. Without WebGL2 these builds draw
    # nothing, loudly - cartoon/geom.js says so on the console rather than
    # leaving a blank canvas. And SVG export is gone from them: the GPU refuses
    # an export context by design (paintgl.js checks ctx.getSerializedSvg), so
    # vector output only ever came from the 2D painter. The Save panel hides the
    # option when that painter is absent.

    # A structure on someone's web page: parse, render, and a JS API. No panels,
    # no save UI, no session, no alignment.
    # panel + ui are what `controls: true` and `play` need: the embed mounts
    # the notebook's own Style panel and is wired by wireViewerUI, rather than
    # growing a third set of controls to keep in step. 25 KB for exact parity.

    # KEEP, where embed-tube did not: it draws the same picture from the same
    # geometry - one geometry, two painters - so nothing is given up but speed on
    # a large structure, and paint2d.js is 25 KB against paintgl.js's 118, which
    # is 93 KB off the download. It can also export SVG, which the GPU cannot:
    # vector output is the primitives replayed into an SVG context, and the GPU
    # holds a raster. So capture and svg come with it.
