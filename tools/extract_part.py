"""Cut a run of methods out of Pseudo3DRenderer into a part file.

    python3 tools/extract_part.py clip 3575 3912 \\
        --title "CLIP (a part of Pseudo3DRenderer)" \\
        --doc "A slab in camera space..."

The mechanical half of a split, so the same three mistakes are not available
each time: forgetting the comma an object literal needs and a class body does
not, taking a range that starts or ends inside a doc comment, and leaving a copy
behind in the source.

It does NOT decide what to move. Run tools/free_vars.js over the range first and
read the answer - anything under MUST HANDLE has to be dealt with before the
range can go anywhere. This script refuses a range whose free variables it has
not been told about, because a clean extraction that throws ReferenceError on
first use is worse than no extraction.

After it runs, four things still need doing, and tools/bundle.py names all of
them: add the module to MODULES, add the tag to index.html, add the
inline read to viewer.py (AFTER core/mol.js's, because those reads prepend),
and add the file to setup.py. (Upstream also lists the path in
tests/lift.js SOURCES, which this fork does not ship, so the
node tests follow the methods.
