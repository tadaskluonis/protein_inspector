PERSISTENCE & LIVE UPDATE SYSTEM
=================================

The `persistence` parameter controls whether output cells are preserved after notebook reload.

**Quick Summary:**
- persistence=True: add() creates new cells, replace() updates last cell  
- persistence=False: Both update single "mailbox" cell (ephemeral)
- add/replace controls JavaScript frame behavior (append vs replace), independent of persistence

**Implementation:**
- Uses DisplayHandle.update() throughout for safety
- MUST use display_id when calling display() for update() to work

        Initialize a py2Dmol viewer.

        Args:
            size (tuple): Canvas dimensions (width, height) in pixels. Default (400, 400).
            controls (bool): Show playback controls. Default True.
            box (bool): Show bounding box. Default True.
            color (str): Color mode - "auto", "chain", "rainbow", "plddt", "deepmind", "entropy", "ss" (secondary structure). Default "auto".
            colorblind (bool): Use colorblind-friendly palette. Default False.
            ss_palette (str): Named palette for the "ss" colour mode -
                "pymol" (red/yellow/green, the default) or "jmol"
                (magenta/yellow/white). The SSE dropdown in the Style panel
                while colouring by SSE.
            base_plates (bool): Draw DNA/RNA base plates (the rungs of a
                duplex). None (default) leaves the renderer's default (on).
                The Bases toggle in the Style panel.
            thickness (float): Cartoon slab thickness in Angstroms (default
                0, flat single-sheet ribbons). Raise it for solid slabs.
            detail (int): Cartoon subdivisions per residue, 2-8 (default 4).
                Higher is smoother and proportionally slower. 2 is the
                geometric floor - below it a helix cannot represent its own
                coil and the depth sort has nothing to cut on.
            fade (float): Depth fade, 0-1 (default 0 = off) - geometry
                further back pales toward the page. The Fade slider.
                Lower is deliberately faceted and proportionally faster. Values
                above 0.5 are clamped: past the tuned value the extra stations
                cost time without changing the drawn curves.
            smooth (bool): Smooth shading gradients; False draws one flat
                tone per cartoon face (cel shading) - the Smooth toggle.
                Defaults to False for style="cartoon", True otherwise.
            highlight (float): Brightness lift on faces pointing at the light,
                >= 0 (default 1.8). 0 restores the old behaviour where the base
                colour was the ceiling and lighting could only darken.
            outline_tint (float): Cartoon outline colour, 0-1 (default 0.0).
                0 inks pure black; 1 uses a 0.7 tint of the element's own
                colour, matching ribbon mode.
            preset (str): Named cartoon preset, the Preset dropdown in the
                Style panel - "richardson" (the default for style="cartoon":
                the hand-drawn convention of flat wide helices, thick arrowed
                strands, thin round loops), "ribbon" (plain cartoon) or "3d"
                (solid shaded geometry: thickness 1.0, no outline, smooth
                shading, flat sheets, on a black page). Implies
                style="cartoon". An explicit argument always wins over it.

                You can pass these to style= instead - style="ribbon" is the
                same as preset="ribbon" - and that is usually the clearer way
                to say it.
            style (str): Render style - "tube" (smooth backbone trace) or
                "cartoon" (secondary-structure cartoon: helix/strand ribbons,
                loop tubes). Default "tube". These are the only two, because
                they are the only two draw paths; richardson is a preset.
            shadow (bool): Ribbon cast-shadow effect. Default True.
            shade (float): Cartoon directional shading strength, 0-1
                (default 1). 0 is flat colour; 1 is full light, highlight and
                inner shadow, paired with `highlight` in the panel).
            shadow_strength (float): Shadow intensity 0-1. Default 0.5.
            outline (str): Outline mode - "none", "partial", "full". Default "full".
            bg (str): Page background - "white", or "black" (the default
                for preset="3d"). Black
                inks outlines in white and fades depth toward black. The Dark
                toggle.
            width (float): Line width. Default 3.0.
            ortho (float): Orthographic projection strength 0-1. Default 0.5.
            rotate (bool): Auto-rotate the structure. Default False.
            autoplay (bool): Auto-play animation on load. Default False.
            pae (bool): Enable PAE (Predicted Aligned Error) visualization. Default False.
            pae_size (int): PAE plot size in pixels. Default 300.
            scatter (bool/dict): Enable scatter plot. Default None.
            scatter_size (int): Scatter plot size in pixels. Default 300.
            overlay (bool): Enable overlay mode (show all frames simultaneously). Default False.
            multi (bool): Draw every object at once rather than one at a time.
                Default False. `overlay` is about FRAMES of one object; this is
                about OBJECTS - two structures added under different names,
                both on screen, the camera widened to take them both in. The
                same thing the website's Multi button does. See show_objects()
                for naming a subset.
            sidechains (bool): Carry each residue's side-chain atoms, so they
                can be drawn and so Focus can measure side chain to side chain
                rather than trace to trace. Default False.

                THIS IS THE DATA, NOT THE DRAWING. With it on, name the ones
                you want with show_sidechains() / hide_sidechains(), or let
                focus() pick a neighbourhood's for you. Without it there is
                nothing to draw and show_sidechains() says so.

                THE COST IS PER FRAME, because side-chain atoms are
                coordinates and every frame's differ: a 251-residue design goes
                from 9.0 KB a frame to 37.2, so six frames is 54 KB against 223
                and a hundred would be 2.8 MB. A notebook inlines the payload,
                so that is paid in the .ipynb.

                A VIEWER-WIDE setting rather than a per-load one: the table is
                per FRAME with no inheritance, so a viewer holding some frames
                with side chains and some without would make them appear and
                vanish as the reader steps through.
            cyclic (bool): Close a chain end to end when its termini are within
                bonding range - a cyclic peptide drawn as the ring it is rather
                than as a line with two loose ends. Default True. The Cyclic
                toggle in the Style panel is the same setting.
                RENAMED in 2.0.0 from `detect_cyclic`, to match the toggle and
                the rest of view(), where every argument names a state rather
                than an action.
            persistence (bool): If True (default), each incremental update uses a fresh output
                                cell (classic behavior). If False, updates reuse a single hidden
                                cell (mailbox) to avoid output bloat.
            id (str): Custom viewer ID. If None, auto-generated. Default None.
            cutoffs (dict): Maximum distances (Å) for drawing bonds. Keys:
                            "protein_bond" (CA-CA, default 5.0),
                            "nucleic_bond" (C4'-C4', default 7.5),
                            "ligand_bond" (heavy-atom). Left unset, bonds are
                            judged per element pair - S-S out to 2.4 A, C-O to
                            1.65, C-I to 2.4 - from src/io/bonds.js, the same
                            table the file parser uses. Give a number and that
                            number is used for every pair, as it always was.

            plddts (np.array, optional): N-length array of pLDDT scores.
            chains (list, optional): N-length list of chain identifiers.
            position_types (list, optional): N-length list of position types ('P', 'D', 'R', 'L').
            pae (np.array, optional): LxL PAE matrix.
            scatter (list/tuple/dict, optional): Scatter plot data point for this frame.
                   Accepts: [x, y], (x, y), or {"x": x, "y": y}
            name (str, optional): Name for the object. If a different name is provided than the current object, a new object is created.
            align (bool, optional): If True, aligns subsequent frames to the first frame.
                                   Best-view rotation is ALWAYS computed for first frame. Defaults to True.
            allow_reflection (bool, optional): If True, allows mirroring during alignment (may flip chirality). Defaults to False.
            position_names (list, optional): N-length list of position names.
            residue_numbers (list, optional): N-length list of PDB residue sequence numbers (resSeq).
                                              One per position. For ligands, multiple positions may share the same residue number.
            atom_types (list, optional): Backward compatibility alias for position_types (deprecated).
            contacts: Optional contact restraints. Can be a filepath (str) or list of contact arrays.
            bonds (list, optional): List of bonds. Each bond is [atom_idx1,
                atom_idx2]. Given, they are what is drawn. Absent, a ligand's
                bonds are DERIVED from distance - see position_elements.
            position_elements (list, optional): N-length list of chemical
                elements ('C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'FE', ...). Two things read them:
                atoms are coloured by element, and a ligand's bonds are judged
                per PAIR of elements - S-S out to 2.4 A, C-O to 1.65, C-I to
                2.4 - rather than by one distance for everything. Without them
                every pair uses `cutoffs["ligand_bond"]`, 2.0 A, which misses a
                disulfide at 2.05 and joins an O...O contact at 1.9. Only
                ligand atoms and drawn side chains have an element to read.
            color: Frame-level color. Can be:
                   - String (mode): "chain", "plddt", "rainbow", "auto", "entropy", "deepmind"
                   - String (literal): "red", "#ff0000", etc.
                   - Dict (advanced): {"frame": mode/color, "chain": {...}, "position": {...}}

        Loads a structure from a local PDB or CIF file and adds it to the viewer

        This method does *not* call .show().

        Multi-model files are added as a single object.

        Args:
            filepath (str): Path to the PDB or CIF file.
            chains (list, optional): Specific chains to load. Defaults to all.
            name (str, optional): Name for the object. If a different name is provided than the current object, a new object is created.
            paes (list, optional): List of PAE matrices to associate with each model.
            align (bool, optional): If True, aligns subsequent frames to the first frame.
                                   Best-view rotation is ALWAYS computed for first frame. Defaults to True.
            use_biounit (bool): Build the biological assembly, which is what
                                the molecule actually is - a trimer rather than
                                one protomer. On by default, as on the website.
                                A file with no assembly records is loaded as it
                                is. False for the asymmetric unit.
            biounit_name (str): The name of the assembly to generate (default "1").
            load_ligands (bool): If True, loads ligand atoms. Defaults to True.
            filter_additives (bool): If True, leaves out buffers, cryoprotectants
                and counter-ions - what the crystal was grown in rather than what
                the molecule is. See CRYSTAL_ADDITIVES. Defaults to True.
            contacts: Optional contact restraints. Can be a filepath (str) or list of contact arrays.
            scatter: Optional scatter plot data for trajectory visualization. Can be:
                    - String: filepath to CSV file (first row = header with xlabel,ylabel; subsequent rows = x,y data)
                    - List/array: [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...] - one point per model/frame
                    When CSV is provided, xlabel/ylabel are extracted and scatter config is updated.
            color (str, optional): Color for this structure. Can be a color mode (e.g., "chain", "plddt",
                                  "rainbow", "auto", "entropy", "deepmind") or a literal color (e.g., "red", "#ff0000").
